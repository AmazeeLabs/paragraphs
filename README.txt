Paragraph is a module to create paragraphs in your content.
You can create bundles(with own display and fields) as paragraph types.

When you use the Entity Reference Paragraphs widget + Entity Reference selection type on your node/entity, you can select the allowed bundles, and when using the widget, you can select a paragraph type from the allowed bundles to use different fields/display per paragraph.

* Different fields per paragraph bundle
* Using different paragraph bundles in a single paragraph field
* Displays per paragraph bundle
